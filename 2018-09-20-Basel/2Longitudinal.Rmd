# Simple longitudinal data

- *Repeated measures* data consist of measurements of a
    response (and, perhaps, some covariates) on several *experimental*
    (or observational) *units*.

- Frequently the experimental (observational) unit is
    *"Subject"* and we will refer to these units as "subjects".
    However, the methods described here are not restricted to
    data on human subjects.

- *Longitudinal* data are repeated measures data in which
    the observations are taken over time.

- We wish to characterize the response over time within subjects and
    the variation in the time trends between subjects.

- Often we are not as interested in comparing the
    particular subjects in the study as much as we are interested in
    modeling the variability in the population from which the subjects
    were chosen.

# Sleep deprivation data

- This laboratory experiment measured the effect of sleep deprivation
    on cognitive performance.

- There were 18 subjects, chosen from the population of interest
    (long-distance truck drivers), in the 10 day trial. These subjects were
    restricted to 3 hours sleep per night during the trial.

- On each day of the trial each subject's reaction time was
    measured.  The reaction time shown here is the average of several
    measurements.

- These data are *balanced* in that each subject is
    measured the same number of times and on the same occasions.

# Comments on the sleep data plot

- The plot is a "trellis" or "lattice" plot where the data
    for each subject are presented in a separate panel.  The axes are
    consistent across panels so we may compare patterns across
    subjects.

- A reference line fit by simple linear regression to the
    panel's data has been added to each panel.

- The aspect ratio of the panels has been adjusted so that a
    typical reference line lies about $45^\circ$ on the page. We have
    the greatest sensitivity in checking for differences in slopes
    when the lines are near $\pm 45^\circ$ on the page.

- The panels have been ordered not by subject number (which is
    essentially a random order) but according to increasing intercept
    for the simple linear regression.  If the slopes and the
    intercepts are highly correlated we should see a pattern across
    the panels in the slopes.

# Assessing the linear fits

- In most cases a simple linear regression provides an adequate
    fit to the within-subject data. 

- Patterns for some subjects (e.g. 350, 352 and 371) deviate
    from linearity but the deviations are neither widespread nor
    consistent in form.

- There is considerable variation in the intercept (estimated
    reaction time without sleep deprivation) across subjects -- 200
    ms. up to 300 ms. -- and in the slope (increase in reaction time
    per day of sleep deprivation) -- 0 ms./day up to 20 ms./day.

- We can examine this variation further by plotting
    confidence intervals for these intercepts and slopes.  Because we use a
    pooled variance estimate and have balanced data, the intervals
    have identical widths.

- We again order the subjects by increasing intercept so we can
    check for relationships between slopes and intercepts.

# 95% conf int on within-subject intercept and slope

```{r Sl1,dev='svg',echo=FALSE,fig.height=4.5,fig.align='center'}
print(plot(confint(lmList(Reaction ~ Days | Subject, sleepstudy),
                   pooled = TRUE), order = 1))
``` 


  These intervals reinforce our earlier impressions of considerable
  variability between subjects in both intercept and slope but little
  evidence of a relationship between intercept and slope.

# A preliminary mixed-effects model

- We begin with a linear mixed model in which the fixed effects $[\beta_1,\beta_2]^\prime$ are the representative intercept and slope for the population and the random effects $\mathbf b_i=[b_{i1},b_{i2}]^\prime, i=1,\dots,18$ are the deviations in intercept and slope associated with subject $i$.

- The random effects vector, $\mathbf b$, consists of the $18$ intercept effects followed by the $18$ slope effects.

# Terms and matrices

- The term `Days` in the formula generates a model matrix
    $\mathbf X$ with two columns, the intercept column and the numeric
    `Days` column.  (The intercept is included unless
    suppressed.)

- The term `(Days|Subject)` generates a vector-valued
    random effect (intercept and slope) for each of the $18$ levels of
    the `Subject` factor.

---
class: left, top

# A model with uncorrelated random effects

- The data plots gave little indication of a systematic
    relationship between a subject's random effect for slope and
    his/her random effect for the intercept.  Also, the estimated
    correlation is quite small.

- We should consider a model with uncorrelated random effects.
    To express this we use two random-effects terms with the same
    grouping factor and different left-hand sides.  

- In the formula for
    an `lmer` model, distinct random effects terms are modeled as
    being independent. Thus we specify the model with two distinct
    random effects terms, each of which has `Subject` as the
    grouping factor.  
    
- The model matrix for one term is intercept only
    (`1`) and for the other term is the column for `Days`
    only, which can be written `0+Days`. (The expression
    `Days` generates a column for `Days` and an intercept.
    To suppress the intercept we add `0+` to the expression;
    `-1` also works.)

# Comparing the models

- Model `fm1` contains model `fm2` in the sense that
    if the parameter values for model `fm1` were constrained so
    as to force the correlation, and hence the covariance, to be zero,
    and the model were re-fit, we would get model `fm2`.
    
- The value `0`, to which the correlation is constrained, is
    not on the boundary of the allowable parameter values.
    
- In these circumstances a likelihood ratio test and a reference
    distribution of a $\chi^2$ on 1 degree of freedom is suitable.

```{r anovafm1fm2}
anova(fm2, fm1)
```

class: left, top

# Conclusions from the likelihood ratio test

- Because the large p-value indicates that we would not reject
    `fm2` in favor of `fm1`, we prefer the more parsimonious
    `fm2`.
    
- This conclusion is consistent with the AIC (Akaike's
    Information Criterion) and the BIC (Bayesian Information
    Criterion) values for which "smaller is better".
    
- We can also use a Bayesian approach, where we regard the
    parameters as themselves being random variables, is assessing the
    values of such parameters.  A currently popular Bayesian method is
    to use sequential sampling from the conditional distribution of
    subsets of the parameters, given the data and the values of the
    other parameters.  The general technique is called *Markov-chain Monte Carlo* sampling.
      
- We will expand on the use of likelihood-ratio tests in the next section.

# Comparing within-subject coefficients

- For this model we can combine the conditional means of the
    random effects and the estimates of the fixed effects to get
    conditional means of the within-subject coefficients.

- These conditional means will be "shrunken" towards the
    fixed-effects estimates relative to the estimated coefficients
    from each subject's data.  John Tukey called this "borrowing
    strength" between subjects.

- Plotting the shrinkage of the within-subject coefficients
    shows that some of the coefficients are considerably shrunken
    toward the fixed-effects estimates.

- However, comparing the within-group and mixed model fitted
    lines shows that large changes in coefficients occur in the noisy
    data.  Precisely estimated within-group coefficients are not
    changed substantially.

# Conclusions from the example

- Carefully plotting the data is enormously helpful in
    formulating the model.

- It is relatively easy to fit and evaluate models to data like
    these, from a balanced designed experiment.

- We consider two models with random effects for the slope and
    the intercept of the response w.r.t. time by subject.  The models
    differ in whether the (marginal) correlation of the vector of
    random effects per subject is allowed to be nonzero.

- The "estimates" (actually, the conditional means) of the
    random effects can be considered as penalized estimates of these
    parameters in that they are shrunk towards the origin.

- Most of the prediction intervals for the random effects
    overlap zero.

---
class: left, top

# Random slopes and interactions

- In the `sleepstudy` model fits we allowed for random
    effects for `Days` by `Subject`.

- These random effects can be considered as an interaction
    between the fixed-effects covariate `Days` and the
    random-effects factor `Subject`.

- When we have both fixed-levels categorical covariates and
    random-levels categorical covariates we have many different ways
    in which interactions can be expressed.

- Often the wide range of options provides "enough rope to hang
    yourself" in the sense that it is very easy to create an
    overly-complex model.

# The `Multilocation data set`

- Data from a multi-location trial of several treatments are
    described in section 2.8 of Littell, Milliken, Stroup and
    Wolfinger (1996) \textbf{SAS System for Mixed Models} and are
    available as `Multilocation` in package `SASmixed`.

- Littell et al. don't cite the source of the data.  Apparently
    `Adj` is an adjusted response of some sort for 4 different
    treatments applied at each of 3 blocks in each of 9 locations.
    Because `Block` is implicitly nested in `Location`, the
    `Grp` interaction variable was created.

```{r Multilocation}
str(Multilocation)
```

# Response by `Grp` and `Trt`

              groups=Trt, type=c("p","a"),
              auto.key=list(columns=4,lines=TRUE)))
```

- From this one plot (Littell et al. do not provide any plots but
  instead immediately jump into fitting several "cookie-cutter"
  models) we see differences between locations, not as much between
  blocks within location, and treatment 2 providing a lower adjusted
  response.

# Fixed-levels categorical covariates and "contrasts"

- In this experiment we are interested in comparing the
    effectiveness of these four levels of `Trt`.

- That is, the levels of `Trt` are fixed levels and we
    should incorporate them in the fixed-effects part of the model.

- Unlike the situation with random effects, we cannot separately
    estimate "effects" for each level of a categorical covariate in
    the fixed-effects and an overall intercept term.

- We could suppress the intercept term but even then we still
    encounter redundancies in effects for each level when we have more
    than one categorical covariate in the fixed-effects.

- Because of this we estimate coefficients for $k-1$ "contrasts"
    associated with the $k$ levels of a factor.

- The default contrasts (called `contr.treatment`) measure
    changes relative to a reference level which is the first level of
    the factor.  Other contrasts can be used when particular
    comparisons are of interest.

```{r fm3}
print(fm3 <- lmer(Adj ~ Trt + (1|Grp), Multilocation), corr=FALSE)
```   


---
class: left, top

# Interpretation of the results

- We see that the variability between the Location/Block
    combinations (levels of `Grp`)  is greater than the residual
    variability, indicating the importance of controlling for it.

- The contrast between levels 2 and 1 of `Trt`, labeled
    `Trt2` is the greatest difference and apparently significant.

- If we wish to evaluate the "significance" of the levels of
    `Trt` as a group, however, we should fit the trivial
    model and perform a LRT.

```{r lrt}
fm4 <- lmer(Adj ~ 1 + (1|Grp), Multilocation)
anova(fm4, fm3)
```   


---
class: left, top

# Location as a fixed-effetc

- We have seen that `Location` has a substantial effect on
    `Adj`.  If we are interested in these specific 9 locations
    we could incorporate them as fixed-effects parameters.

- Instead of examining 8 coefficients separately we will
    consider their cumulative effect using the single-argument form of
    `anova`.

```{r fm5}
anova(fm5 <- lmer(Adj ~ Location + Trt + (1|Grp), Multilocation))
```   


---
class: left, top

# An interaction between fixed-effects factors

- We could ask if there is an interaction between the levels of
    `Trt` and those of `Location` considered as fixed effects.

```{r fm6}
anova(fm6 <- lmer(Adj ~ Location*Trt + (1|Grp), Multilocation))
anova(fm5, fm6)
```

# Is `Grp` needed in addition to `Location`?

- At this point we may want to check whether the random effect
    for `Block` within `Location` is needed in addition to
    the random effect for `Location`.

```{r fm8}
fm8 <- lmer(Adj ~ Trt + (1|Location), Multilocation)
anova(fm8, fm7)
```   

- Apparently not, but we may want to revisit this issue after
  checking for interactions.

# Ways of modeling random/fixed interactions

- There are two ways we can model the interaction between a
    fixed-levels factor (`Trt`) and a random-levels factor
    (`Location`, as we are currently viewing this factor).

- The first, and generally preferable, way is to incorporate a
    simple scalar random-effects term with the interaction as the grouping
    factor.

- The second, more complex, way is to use vector-valued random
    effects for the random-levels factor.  We must be careful when
    using this approach because it often produces a degenerate model,
    but not always obviously degenerate.

```{r anovafm10}

- We have switched to ML fits because we are comparing models
  using `anova`.  In a comparative `anova` any REML fits are
  refit as ML before comparison so we start with the ML fits.

- In model `fm9` the estimated variance for the scalar
  interaction random effects was exactly zero in the ML fit.  In
  `fm10` the estimate is positive but still not significant.

---
class: left, top

# Vector-valued random effects

- An alternative formulation for an interaction between
    `Trt` and `Location` (viewed as a random-levels factor)
    is to use vector-valued random effects.
- We have used a similar construct in model `fm1` with
    vector-valued random effects (intercept and slope) for each level
    of `Subject`.
- One way to fit such a model is
```{r fm11a,eval=FALSE}
fm11 <- lmer(Adj ~ Trt + (Trt|Location) + (1|Grp), Multilocation, REML=FALSE)
``` 
but interpretation is easier when fit as
```{r fm11b,eval=FALSE}
fm11 <- lmer(Adj ~ Trt + (0+Trt|Location) + (1|Grp), Multilocation, REML=FALSE)
```

# Examining correlation of random effects

- The random effects summary for `fm11`

```{r echo=FALSE}
cat(paste(capture.output(print(fm11))[4:15], collapse="\n"), "\n")
```   
shows very high correlations between the random effects for the levels
of `Trt` within each level of `Location`.
- Such a situation may pass by unnoticed if estimates of variances and
  covariances are all that is reported.
- In this case (and many other similar cases) the
  variance-covariance matrix of the vector-valued random effects is
  effectively singular.



---
class: left, top


# Singular variance-covariance for random effects

- When we incorporate too many fixed-effects terms in a model we
    usually find out because the standard errors become very large.

- For random effects terms, especially those that are
    vector-valued, overparameterization is sometimes more difficult to detect.

- The REML and ML criteria for mixed-effects models seek to
    balance the complexity of the model versus the fidelity of the
    fitted values to the observed responses.

- The way "complexity" is measured in this case, a model with a singular
    variance-covariance matrix for the random effects is considered a
    good thing - it is optimally simple.

- When we have only scalar random-effects terms singularity
    means that one of the variance components must be exactly zero
    (and "near singularity" means very close to zero).

# Detecting singular random effects

- The `Lambda` slot in a `merMod` object is the
    triangular factor of the variance-covariance matrix.

- We can directly assess its condition number using the
    `kappa` (condition number) or `rcond` (reciprocal
    condition number) functions.  Large condition numbers are bad.

- We do need to be cautious when we have a large number of
    levels for the grouping factors because `Lambda` will be
    **very** large (but also very sparse).  At present the
    `kappa` and `rcond` functions transform the sparse
    matrix to a dense matrix, which could take a very long time.

```{r fm11kappa}
kappa(getME(fm11, "Lambda"))
rcond(getME(fm11, "Lambda"))
```

# Using verbose model fits

- An alternative, which is recommended whenever you have doubts
    about a model fit, is to use `verbose=TRUE` (the lines don't
    wrap and we miss the interesting part here).

```{r fm11verb,echo=FALSE}
fm11 <- lmer(Adj ~ Trt + (0+Trt|Location) + (1|Grp), Multilocation, REML=FALSE, verbose=TRUE)
```   
```{r fm11}
getME(fm11,"theta")
```

  # What to watch for in the verbose output

- In this model the criterion is being optimized with respect to
    11 parameters.

- These are the variance component parameters, $\theta$.  The
    fixed-effects coefficients, $\beta$, and the common scale
    parameter, $\sigma$, are at their conditionally optimal values.

- Generally it is more difficult to estimate a variance
    parameter (either a variance or a covariance) than it is to
    estimate a coefficient.  Estimating 11 such parameters requires a
    considerable amount of information.

- Some of these parameters are required to be non-negative.
    When they become zero or close to zero ($2.7\times10^{-7}$, in
    this case) the variance-covariance matrix is degenerate.

- The `getME(m, "lower")` value contains the lower bounds.
    Parameter components for which `getME(m, "lower")` is `-Inf` are
    unbounded.  The ones to check are those for which `getME(m, "lower")`
    is `0`.

# Fitting a model to the Early data

- The `Early` data in the `mlmRev` package are from a
    study on early childhood cognitive development as influenced by a
    treatment.  These data are discussed in **Applied Longitudinal Data Analysis** (2003) by Singer and Willett.

- A model with random effects for slope and intercept is

```{r fm12}
Early <- within(Early, tos <- age-0.5)
fm12 <- lmer(cog ~ tos+trt:tos+(tos|id), Early, verbose=TRUE)
```   


---
class: left, top

# Fitted model for the Early data
```{r fm12show,echo=FALSE}
print(fm12, corr=FALSE)
```   
Here is it obvious that there is a problem.  However, Singer and
Willett did not detect this in model fits from SAS PROC MIXED or
MLWin, both of which reported a covariance estimate.

# Other practical issues

- In some disciplines there is an expectation that data will be
    analyzed starting with the most complex model and evaluating terms
    according to their p-values.

- This can be appropriate for carefully balanced, designed
    experiments.  It is rarely a good approach on observational,
    imbalanced data.

- Bear in mind that this approach was formulated when graphical
    and computational capabilities were very limited.

- A more appropriate modern approach is to explore the data
    graphically and to fit models sequentially, comparing these fitted
    models with tests such as the LRT.

# Fixed-effects or random-effects?

- Earlier we described the distinction between fixed and
    random effects as dependent on the repeatability of the levels.

- This is the basis for the distinction but the number of levels
    observed must also be considered.

- Fitting mixed-effects models requires data from several levels
    of the grouping factor.  Even when a factor represents a random
    selection (say sample transects in an ecological study) it is not
    practical to estimate a variance component from only two or three
    observed levels.

- At the other extreme, a census of a large number of levels can
    be modeled with random effects even though the observed levels are
    not a sample.

# Summary

- In models of longitudinal data on several subjects we often
    incorporate random effects for the intercept and/or the slope of
    the response with respect to time.

- By default we allow for a general variance-covariance matrix
    for the random effects for each subject.

- The model can be restricted to independent random effects when
    appropriate.

- For other interactions of fixed-effects factors and
    random-effects grouping factors, the general term can lead to
    estimation of many variance-covariance parameters.  We may want to
    restrict to independent random effects for the subject and the
    subject/type interaction.
